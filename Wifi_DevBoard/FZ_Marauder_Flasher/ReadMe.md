![Screenshot_v1 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57457139/184584304-482ac7ea-0825-463b-b4f8-71885b457e1a.png)

## Now it's as easy as 1, 2, 3 to install or update Marauder on Windows.

1. Download and extract [the ZIP file](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/raw/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher/FZ_Marauder_v1.4.zip) above to the same directory.<br>
2. Hold `BOOT` on the devboard and plug it into your PC directly via USB.<br>
3. Double-click `flash.bat` from the extracted files then choose `Flash` or `Update`.

* If you choose `Flash Marauder` the script will locate your board and flash Marauder automatically!<br>
* If you choose `Update Marauder` you'll be taken to the Marauder download location to grab a new version.<br>
(Simply download the BIN file as stated and stick it in the Marauder subfolder of the batch file.)<br>
* If you choose `Save Flipper Blackmagic WiFi settings` your current Blackmagic configuration will be saved.<br>
* If you choose `Flash Flipper Blackmagic` the script will flash the original Blackmagic firmware it shipped with.

Current Marauder version included in the ZIP: v0.9.15.20220907 (current release as of Sept 7, 2022)
